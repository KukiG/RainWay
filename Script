To get started, you need to become a Rainway partner.

1. Check out the Rainway Dashboard installation video tutorial: https://bitbucket.org/rainwayapp/rainwayapplication/downloads/Rainway_Installation.mp4

2. Download Rainway Dashboard on Windows and register for an account: https://rainway.tv/download.html

3. Once you have successfully registered in the Rainway Dashboard, you will need to fill in the Partners tab with your social media links, payment information, phone number, current work email address - congratulations, you are a Rainway Dashboard Partner. The phone number will have to be confirmed by SMS verification.

4. Send a screenshot of the filled Partners tab with a reply message.


Once you are part of Rainway, we need to discuss contract and payment details. (Length of video, Social Platform(s), deadlines). And the best way to do this would be in Discord or Zoom. Would it be convenient for you? 

Payment is made in full after the arrangements to your given payment method. After that, you get to work and you will have a set deadline by which the integration must be done.
